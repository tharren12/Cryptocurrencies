# Cryptocurrencies

## Overview

Our client was interested in offering a new cryptocurrenty investment portfolio for its customers. The company, however, is lost in the vast universe of cryptocurrencies. So, they have asked us to create a report that includes what cryptocurrencies are on the trading market and how they could be grouped to create a classification system for this new investment. We decided to use unsupervised learning. We decided on a clustering algorithm to group the data, and data visualizations to share our findings with the board.
